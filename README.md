This package provides an easy way to create crud-based feature tests.

## Installation

You can install this package via composer using:

```bash
composer require modulero/cruddy-tests
```

The package will automatically register itself.

To publish the config file to `config/cruddy-tests.php` run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Modulero\CruddyTests\CruddyTestsServiceProvider"
```

This will publish a file `cruddy-tests.php` in your config directory with the following contents:

```php
return [
    
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Default Resource Abilities
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This array of abilities will be used to determine which cruddy tests
    | needs to be made. Feel free to change this into something you want.
    |
    */
   
    'abilities' => [
        'viewAny',
        'view',
        'create',
        'update',
        'delete',
    ],

];
```

## Usage

After you've installed the package and you've optionally overwritten the values in the config-file working with this package will be a breeze. 

The only thing you need to do is calling the artisan command

```bash
php artisan make:cruddy-tests Foo
```

This will create a folder in the Tests\Feature namespace with the name Foo. In this folder files will be created based on the resource abilities in your config settings. With the default config it will create these files:

+ ViewAnyFooTest
+ ViewFooTest
+ CreateFooTest
+ UpdateFooTest
+ DeleteFooTest

For certain resources you might not need all the available abilities. For this purpose you can use the options `--only` and `--except`.

```bash
php artisan make:cruddy-tests Foo --only=create
```

```bash
php artisan make:cruddy-tests Foo --except=view,delete
```

You can add multiple abilities through a comma-separated list. The names need to match the ones in your config file. It is not recommended to use both options at the same time. When you do the `--only` option takes precedence.
